## Prerequisites

Before running this application, you will need:

- Node.js 18+ installed
- An OpenAI API key (or Deepseek API key)
- Google OAuth Credentials (Client ID and Secret)

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory with the following content. You can get Google credentials from the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials).

```dotenv
# AI API Keys (at least one is required)
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=your_deepseek_api_key
GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY=your_google_generative_api_key
# Google OAuth Credentials
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_google_client_id
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_google_client_secret

# NextAuth.js Secret (generate a random string, e.g., using `openssl rand -base64 32`)
AUTH_SECRET=your_secure_random_string

# Redis connection URL (for session storage and rate limiting)
# Example for Upstash: redis://default:<password>@<region>.<id>.upstash.io:<port>
UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL=your_upstash_redis_url
UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN=your_upstash_redis_token

# Stripe Configuration
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_... or sk_live_...
STRIPE_PRICE_ID=price_... # Price ID for the '5 Extra Generations' product
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_... # Get this from your Stripe webhook settings
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_... or pk_live_... # Your Stripe publishable key

# Base URL of your application (important for NextAuth redirects and Stripe redirects)
# Example: http://localhost:3000 for development
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000 # Also needed for Stripe redirects
```

**Important:** Add `.env*.local` to your `.gitignore` file to avoid committing your secrets.

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
# or
pnpm install
# or
bun install
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) (or your configured `NEXTAUTH_URL`) in your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
