       1. NUMBER OF CORRECT ANSWERS:

          - MAXIMUM: Each question MUST have NO MORE than ${maxCorrectAnswers} correct answer(s)
          - RANDOM: Pick a random number between these limits for each question
       
       2. VARIATION REQUIREMENTS:
          - CONSECUTIVE QUESTIONS must have DIFFERENT numbers of correct answers
          - Example: If Q1 has ${minCorrectAnswers} correct answers, Q2 MUST have a different number
          - NEVER repeat the same number of correct answers in consecutive questions
       
       3. DISTRIBUTION:
          - Try to use all possible numbers between ${minCorrectAnswers} and ${maxCorrectAnswers}
          - Distribute the variations evenly across all questions
       
       4. TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:
          - Set 'correctAnswersCount' field to the exact number used in each question
          - All correct answers must be equally valid and complete
          - Double-check that NO question violates the min/max limits`

              Follow these principles when generating ${questionCount} questions:
              
              1. Progressive difficulty: Start with foundational concepts and gradually increase complexity
              2. Cognitive levels: Include a mix of recall, understanding, application, and analysis questions
              3. Clear language: Use precise, unambiguous wording that focuses on key concepts
              4. Plausible options: For multiple choice, all distractors should be realistic and based on common misconceptions
              5. Learning value: Each question should reinforce important concepts from the content
              
              ${typePrompt}
              
              For true/false, avoid absolute statements and focus on testing understanding.
              For multiple-choice, ensure all options are of similar length and grammatically consistent.
              For short answers, specify clearly what constitutes a complete response.

              You must strictly use this type of questions: ${questionType.replace(
                  "-",
                  " "
              )}

              If there is only a question type, you must avoid using other types of questions.
              
              Additional requirements:
              - When the content comes from a PDF or document with pages, include the page number where the answer can be found in the 'page' field
              - The page number should be extracted from the context where the answer is found
              - If no specific page number is available, omit the page field
              
              For example, if the answer comes from "Page 5:" in the text, set page: 5 in the response.
              
              For multiple-choice questions, you MUST follow these rules strictly:
              - Generate exactly ${optionsCount} options
              ${correctAnswersPrompt}
              - The 'correctAnswer' field MUST be an array of indices for multiple correct answers

              Important requirements for multiple answers:
              - All correct answers must be equally valid
              - The correctAnswer field must always be an array, even for single answers
              - Distribute correct answers randomly among the options
              - Include clear explanations why each selected answer is correct
              
              ${systemPrompt ? `Custom Behaviour: ${systemPrompt}` : ""}

              You must speak STRICTLY in the same language as the content provided, if there are different languages in the user input,
              prioritize the language where the content is most.
