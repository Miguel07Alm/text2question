              Follow these principles when generating ${questionCount} questions:
              
              1. Progressive difficulty: Start with foundational concepts and gradually increase complexity
              2. Cognitive levels: Include a mix of recall, understanding, application, and analysis questions
              3. Clear language: Use precise, unambiguous wording that focuses on key concepts
              4. Plausible options: For multiple choice, all distractors should be realistic and based on common misconceptions
              5. Learning value: Each question should reinforce important concepts from the content
              
              ${typePrompt}
              
              Use the same language as the language that is more repeated in the input content and maintain consistent terminology.
              For true/false, avoid absolute statements and focus on testing understanding.
              For multiple-choice, ensure all options are of similar length and grammatically consistent.
              For short answers, specify clearly what constitutes a complete response.

              You must strictly use this type of questions: ${questionType.replace(
                  "-",
                  " "
              )}

              If there is only a question type, you must avoid using other types of questions.
              
              Important: Ensure hints (when provided) guide thinking rather than give away answers.
              For multiple-choice questions, generate exactly ${optionsCount} options.

              Additional requirements:
              - When the content comes from a PDF or document with pages, include the page number where the answer can be found in the 'page' field
              - The page number should be extracted from the context where the answer is found
              - If no specific page number is available, omit the page field
              
              For example, if the answer comes from "Page 5:" in the text, set page: 5 in the response.
